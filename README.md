# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions to the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.  Problems solved primarily in **Rust** (Blazingly Fastâ„¢) with some other languages like **Go** and **Python** thrown in on the days I had time to do it in multiple languages.

To faciliate easily jumping into each day's problem, I have a setup script (written for **nushell**, which is the best shell) in the root directory which will create a new Rust project and seed it with the basic outline of the solution.  You can create a new day in repository by running
```nu
./init.nu 0
```
from the root directory of this project.  Please substitute the day number you'd like to seed in for the `0` in the above command.
