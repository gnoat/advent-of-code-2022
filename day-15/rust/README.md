# AoC Day 15 Rust

Just a quick note about this problem.  For part one, I took the brute force approach, which obviously doesn't work well for part two.  For part two, I precalculated all ranges for each row and found the disjoint row.  A lot of optimizations possible with this if I have time in the future.
