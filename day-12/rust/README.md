# Best Way to View this Solution

You can read the solutions by simply running this Rust crate, but to get the full effect you should run 
```bash
python3 view.py
```
from the root Day 12 Rust solution directory.  This is a simply Python script runs the Rust program, captures the output, and visualizes the path taken.

The Rust solution for this day is a modified form of Dijkstra's algorithm applied forward from the start for the first part and applied backwards from the end for the second.

Obvi to run this script you need to have some form of **Python 3** and **Rust** installed on your system.  If you don't have both installed on your system, I've recorded a GIF of the output you can view.  Simply open up `solution-animation.gif` and enjoy.
