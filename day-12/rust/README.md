# Best Way to View this Solution

You can read the solutions by simply running this Rust crate, but to get the full effect you should run 
```python
python3 view.py
```
from the root Day 12 Rust solution directory.  This is a simply Python script runs the Rust program, captures the output, and visualizes the path taken.

The Rust solution for this day is a modified form of Dijkstra's algorithm applied forward from the start for the first part and applied backwards from the end for the second.
